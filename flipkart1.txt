The device looks good, feels good and feels premimum too. Will update my review after using it for a month or two.

Update 1: It's been a week and I've been in love with the camera on this one. The One UI 3.1 feels so smooth and haven't experienced any such lag or excessive heating while gaming.

Update 2: Battery backup is decent getting screen on time around 6 -7 hours on moderate use.

Update 3: I have attached the samples. Night mode shots are absoulte gorgeous. Recent updates have significantly improved the battery life and camera performances as well.

This is my first Samsung phone. I moved from oneplus after using it for 3 years.

What I like:
1. Display. Just amazing. Adaptive brightness is very good.
2. Battery. Decent lasts easily for a day.
3. Camera. One of the best. Color is highly accurate. Night mode is awesome. OIS is great.
4. eSim is handy
5. Performance. No complaints at all.
6. Temperature management.
7. Samsung keyboard is awesome. In my oneplus, I used to type wring keys. I don't have that problem any more.

What I didn't like:
1. I would have preferred stock android. After using it two weeks got used to it. Believe me I had to Google for restarting the phone.
2. Too many Samsung apps.

Value for money: Without any offers, it is expensive. Discount on hdfc card and redemption offer galaxy watch, I find it okay

I'm overall satisfied. Samsung customer care is very good after talking to them for redemption topics.

Everything abt it awsome..battery backup has been improved.
Fingerprint sensor has been greatly improved..its very fast now.
Except its price in india and ofcourse heating is still there fr day to day uses..i dont even do gaming..would suggest all to wait fr s20fe 5g version in india whch may come with a snapdragon.

As of now the only major prblm is its heating. Its not overheating but it does heat unnecessarily. Its 38¬∞ now during this review

This phone is a beast. This doesn't heat that much. I saw tons of reviews in which people complained about heating. Maybe it's vary from environment to environment. Camera quality is amazing. Only thing i don't like is that you have to buy tons of accessories. Charger , wireless earphone or a type c to 3.5mm jack.
One more thing if you notice carefully you will see that it comes with a thin screen guard.

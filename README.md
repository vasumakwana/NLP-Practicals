# Practical-1


If you want to fetch some other product review data other than "Samsung Galaxy S21" as I have done in this project,

then just enter your choiced product name in "search.send_keys("enter your product name here")" in the flipkart scrapper.py file.

and the result will be stored in text format in 'flipkart1.txt'.
